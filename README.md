# 🔗 Interactive Linked Lists Tutorial

An interactive web application built with Streamlit to learn and visualize different types of linked lists with hands-on demonstrations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic diagrams showing how linked lists work
- **Multiple Types**: Covers Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists
- **Hands-on Demos**: Add, remove, and manipulate list elements in real-time
- **Code Examples**: Complete implementation examples in Python
- **Responsive Design**: Modern UI with smooth animations and transitions

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Basic Concepts
- What is a Linked List and how it differs from arrays
- Node structure with data and pointer fields
- Memory layout comparison between arrays and linked lists
- Advantages and disadvantages of linked lists

### Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List**
   - Forward traversal only
   - Interactive add/remove operations
   - Complete Python implementation

2. **Doubly Linked List**
   - Bidirectional traversal
   - Previous and next pointers
   - Enhanced navigation capabilities

3. **Circular Linked List**
   - Continuous circular traversal
   - Round-robin scheduling applications
   - Infinite loop demonstrations
